Current 4 Spotify Tools Tabs
Resolve Mismatches - JSON-based, shows playlist creation mismatches
Resolve Not Found - JSON-based, shows tracks not found on Spotify
Resolve Unmatched Tracks - DB-based, shows post-play unmatched tracks
Not Found During Export - Another "not found" category

Problems with Current Structure
Conceptual Overlap:
"Resolve Not Found" vs "Not Found During Export" - confusing distinction
"Resolve Mismatches" vs "Resolve Unmatched Tracks" - solving similar problems differently
Multiple data sources (JSON files vs database) for similar use cases
User Confusion:
Which tab should I check first?
Why are there two "not found" tabs?
How do these relate to each other?
Proposed New Structure
Based on our database view approach, here's a cleaner organization:

Option A: Status-Based Tabs
🔍 Review Matches

All mismatch_accepted status - system found something but wasn't confident
User can approve/reject the system's choice
❌ Manual Resolution

All unmatched status - system couldn't match at all
User provides manual Spotify URI
✅ Confirmed Resolutions

All manual_match and approved matches
Read-only view for auditing
🚫 Not on Spotify

All not_found_in_spotify status
Tracks confirmed to not exist on Spotify
Option B: Workflow-Based Tabs
🎯 Smart Suggestions

System found potential matches, user approves/rejects
Combines current "mismatches" + fuzzy matching for unmatched
🔧 Manual Linking

User manually provides Spotify URIs
For tracks system couldn't find at all
📊 Resolution History

All completed resolutions with ability to undo/modify
Better audit trail than current system
⚙️ Resolution Settings

Configure matching sensitivity
Bulk operations (approve all remasters, etc.)
Option C: Simplified Approach
🎵 Needs Review

Everything that needs human attention (mismatch_accepted, unmatched)
Single queue, prioritized by confidence/date
🔗 Manual Resolution

For cases where automatic matching failed completely
User provides Spotify URI manually
📈 Resolution Analytics

Success rates, common mismatch patterns
Help improve automatic matching
Recommendation: Option C + Database View
I recommend Option C because:

Simpler - Fewer decisions for users to make
Cleaner - Single queue of work to be done
Scalable - Easy to add filters/sorting within tabs
Database-powered - All driven by our new spotify_resolution_view
Updated Implementation Plan Addition
Phase 3: UI Redesign (After Phase 1 & 2)
Step 1: Create New Route Structure
Step 2: Update Navigation
Replace 4 confusing tabs with 2-3 clear ones based on user workflow

Step 3: Enhanced User Experience
Batch operations - "Approve all remasters"
Smart filtering - By artist, date, confidence level
Better visualizations - Show before/after comparisons
Undo capability - Reverse incorrect resolutions
Which option appeals to you most? Should we add this Phase 3 to our implementation plan?

Your suggestions sound great. Please move on to implementing this.
