# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing duplicate song management system by adding a persistent holding area for duplicate detection results. Currently, when users navigate away from the duplicate management screen, all analysis data is lost and must be regenerated. This enhancement will store duplicate detection results in the database, allowing users to return to their work later while being informed about the age of the data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want duplicate detection results to be automatically saved when generated, so that I don't lose my work when navigating away from the duplicate management screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL automatically save the results to a persistent storage
2. WHEN duplicate results are saved THEN the system SHALL record the timestamp of when the analysis was performed
3. WHEN saving duplicate results THEN the system SHALL associate the results with the current user session or user account
4. IF duplicate analysis fails to save THEN the system SHALL display a warning message but still show the results in the current session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see when duplicate detection results were last generated, so that I can understand how current the data is and decide whether to refresh it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the duplicate management screen THEN the system SHALL display the timestamp of when the current results were generated
2. WHEN displaying the timestamp THEN the system SHALL show both the absolute time and relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago")
3. WHEN duplicate results are older than 24 hours THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator suggesting the data may be stale
4. WHEN no previous results exist THEN the system SHALL indicate that analysis needs to be performed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manually refresh duplicate detection results, so that I can ensure I'm working with the most current data after making changes to my library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing saved duplicate results THEN the system SHALL provide a "Refresh Analysis" button or link
2. WHEN I click refresh THEN the system SHALL perform a new duplicate analysis and update the saved results
3. WHEN refresh is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator and disable the refresh button
4. WHEN refresh completes THEN the system SHALL update the timestamp and display the new results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the system to automatically detect when my library has changed significantly, so that I can be prompted to refresh duplicate analysis when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracks are added, modified, or deleted THEN the system SHALL track these changes
2. WHEN significant changes are detected (more than 10 tracks modified since last analysis) THEN the system SHALL display a notification suggesting refresh
3. WHEN I access duplicate management after library changes THEN the system SHALL show a banner indicating results may be outdated
4. WHEN I choose to ignore the suggestion THEN the system SHALL remember this choice for the current session

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see detailed progress and status information about duplicate detection, so that I understand what the system is doing during analysis and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate analysis starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar with percentage completion and estimated time remaining
2. WHEN analysis is running THEN the system SHALL show current phase (e.g., "Loading tracks...", "Analyzing similarities...", "Cross-referencing iTunes...")
3. WHEN analysis progresses THEN the system SHALL update progress indicators in real-time showing tracks processed and remaining
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL show summary statistics (total duplicates found, groups identified, processing time, etc.)
5. WHEN analysis encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and allow retry
6. WHEN analysis is cancelled THEN the system SHALL preserve any previously saved results

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see progress updates in the terminal/console logs, so that I can monitor the duplicate detection process when running the application and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate analysis starts THEN the system SHALL log the start time and total number of tracks to process
2. WHEN processing tracks THEN the system SHALL log progress updates every 100 tracks processed (e.g., "Processed 500/2000 tracks")
3. WHEN each major phase completes THEN the system SHALL log the phase completion with timing information
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL log a summary including total duplicates found, processing time, and any errors encountered
5. WHEN errors occur during analysis THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging purposes
6. WHEN logging progress THEN the system SHALL use appropriate log levels (INFO for progress, ERROR for failures, DEBUG for detailed information)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage storage of duplicate detection results, so that the system doesn't accumulate excessive historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate results are saved THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up results older than 30 days
2. WHEN multiple analysis sessions exist THEN the system SHALL keep only the most recent 5 analysis results per user
3. WHEN storage cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL log the cleanup activity for audit purposes
4. WHEN cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating but log the error for administrator review

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to export duplicate detection results, so that I can review them offline or share them with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing duplicate results THEN the system SHALL provide an "Export Results" option
2. WHEN I choose to export THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable file (CSV or JSON format)
3. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include all duplicate group information, metadata, and iTunes match status
4. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a download link and indicate the file format and size

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see the impact of my duplicate management actions, so that I can track progress over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I delete duplicates THEN the system SHALL update the saved results to reflect the changes
2. WHEN viewing results after deletions THEN the system SHALL show which duplicates have been resolved
3. WHEN significant cleanup has occurred THEN the system SHALL suggest running a new analysis to find additional duplicates
4. WHEN I want to see cleanup history THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of recent duplicate management actions
