# Implementation Plan

  - Add UUID generation for unique version identifiers
  - Add error handling and logging for version creation operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.3, 6.1, 6.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement version cleanup and retention management
  - Create `cleanup_old_versions()` method with configurable retention policy (7 days, 10 versions)
  - Implement `cleanup_all_playlists()` method to process all versioned playlists
  - Add `get_version_statistics()` and `get_all_versioned_playlists()` methods for monitoring
  - Create retention logic that preserves versions referenced by recent listening history
  - Add database queries optimized for cleanup operations with proper indexing
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 4. Create integration hooks for playlist generation
  - Modify `generate_default_playlist()` function to trigger versioning before playlist deletion
  - Add versioning hook that captures current playlist state before `Playlist.query.filter_by().delete()`
  - Implement configuration system to enable/disable versioning per playlist or globally
  - Add error handling to ensure playlist generation continues even if versioning fails
  - Test integration with existing scheduled task workflow
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 4.1, 4.3, 5.1, 5.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement enhanced correlation service for listening history
  - Create `get_listening_history_with_versioned_playlist_context()` function that uses versioned data
  - Implement `correlate_track_with_versioned_playlist()` method for individual track correlation
  - Add temporal correlation logic to find correct playlist version based on played_at timestamp
  - Implement fallback mechanism to use current playlist correlation when versioning data unavailable
  - Add confidence indicators for correlation results (high, medium, low, unknown)
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Create database indexes and performance optimizations
  - Add composite index on `playlist_versions(playlist_name, active_from, active_until)` for temporal queries
  - Add index on `playlist_version_tracks(version_id, track_position)` for track lookups
  - Add index on `playlist_versions(created_at)` for cleanup operations
  - Implement query optimization for version correlation with proper JOIN strategies
  - Add caching layer for frequently accessed playlist versions
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 7.2, 7.3_

- [ ] 7. Implement scheduled cleanup task
  - Create scheduled job that runs daily cleanup operations across all versioned playlists
  - Add cleanup task to existing scheduler system with configurable frequency
  - Implement cleanup job that respects retention policy (10 versions or 7 days per playlist)
  - Add logging and monitoring for cleanup operations with statistics reporting
  - Create administrative interface or command for manual cleanup operations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 5.3, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 8. Add configuration management system
  - Create configuration structure for versioning settings (enabled, retention_days, max_versions, enabled_playlists)
  - Implement configuration loading and validation with sensible defaults
  - Add support for enabling/disabling versioning globally or per playlist name pattern
  - Create configuration interface for administrative management
  - Add configuration validation to prevent invalid retention policies
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 5.5, 7.4_

- [ ] 9. Implement comprehensive error handling and monitoring
  - Add error handling for database unavailability during versioning operations
  - Implement retry logic for failed version creation with exponential backoff
  - Add monitoring and alerting for version creation failures and cleanup issues
  - Create health check endpoints for versioning system status
  - Add detailed logging for all versioning operations with appropriate log levels
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.1, 6.4_

- [ ] 10. Update listening history integration
  - Modify existing `get_listening_history_with_playlist_context()` to use versioned correlation when available
  - Update listening history template to display version information and confidence indicators
  - Add fallback display logic when versioned correlation is unavailable
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing listening history functionality
  - Add user-friendly indicators for correlation confidence levels
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 11. Create comprehensive unit tests
  - Write tests for `PlaylistVersioningService` methods with various playlist scenarios
  - Test version creation, temporal correlation, and cleanup operations
  - Create tests for integration hooks with playlist generation workflow
  - Test error handling scenarios including database failures and invalid data
  - Write performance tests for correlation queries with large numbers of versions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 5.1, 7.1_

- [ ] 12. Create integration and system tests
  - Test complete workflow from playlist generation through versioning to correlation
