# Project Brief: kTunes

## 1. Overview

kTunes is a web application designed to manage and integrate music libraries, likely from sources such as iTunes and Spotify. It provides users with tools to organize their music, create and manage playlists, track listening history, and explore music by genres.

## 2. Core Requirements and Goals

The primary goal of kTunes is to offer a centralized platform for music management and playback, bridging different music services.

Key features appear to include:
- **Music Library Management:** Importing, organizing, and displaying tracks, artists, and albums.
- **Playlist Management:** Creating, editing, viewing, and potentially generating playlists.
- **Integration with Music Services:** Connecting with iTunes and Spotify to sync libraries, playlists, and track information.
- **Genre Management:** Assigning and browsing tracks by genre.
- **User Authentication:** Allowing users to register and log in to access their personalized music data.
- **Playback Tracking:** Logging played tracks and potentially providing statistics.
- **Scheduling:** Possible automated tasks related to music library updates or other functions.

## 3. Target Audience

Music enthusiasts who use multiple music services (like iTunes and Spotify) and desire a unified way to manage their collections.

## 4. Key Technologies

Based on the project structure, the following technologies are likely used:
- **Backend:** Python (Flask framework)
- **Database:** SQLite (implied by `instance/kTunes.sqlite`)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (standard web technologies)
- **APIs:** Spotify API (implied by `spotify_app.py`, `spotify_service.py`)

## 5. Scope

The initial scope seems to cover:
- User registration and login.
- Displaying tracks, artists, and playlists.
- Creating and modifying playlists.
- Syncing with Spotify.
- Managing genres.
- Viewing playback history.

Future enhancements could include:
- Advanced playlist generation rules.
- Deeper integration with other music services.
- Social sharing features.
- More detailed analytics and reporting.
- Mobile application.

## 6. Success Metrics (To be defined)

- User engagement (e.g., number of active users, playlists created).
- Successful integration and synchronization with external services.
- User satisfaction with music management capabilities.
